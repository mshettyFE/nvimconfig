Just git clone the repository into the directory ```/home/<username>/.config/nvim``` and it should just work after running the following commands in said directory

```
  chmod +x Setup.sh
  ./Setup.sh
  cd ..
```

You can install additional LSP stuff via ```:Mason```, just make sure you save and quit for changes to take effect
